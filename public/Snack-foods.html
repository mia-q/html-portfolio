        <p>So tasty, so red. If you dont like them, try them again. </p>
    <li><h3>Any Flavor of Ice Cream</h3></li>

        <p>Except maybe mint chip, but even that has it's place on the menu 
            from time to time (apologies to the mint chip lovers).</p>
    <li><h3>French Fries</h3></li>

        <p> I would eat French Fries and every variation on fried potatoes everyday
            if they had any nutritional value. They don't, but they're very tasty.</p>
