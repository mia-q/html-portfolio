<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mia Quintana and I am a self-taught web developer! I am motivated 
  to get better at coding and have found that the crossroads between logic, organization,
   and creativity that comes with coding is the perfect place for me.
</p>

<p>Before learning to code, I was a music teacher for 3 years. I still play my 
  instrument and make music as often as possible just for fun! I then worked for
a small family-owned cleaning company, which allowed me the time and mental energy
to learn how to code!</p>

<p>Though my experience is limited, I am a quick-learner and a hard worker. If given
  the opportunity, I will demonstrate my potential!

<p>This is my cat, Noodlehead!</p>
